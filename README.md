# Attribution

_A [Deliverable](https://www.w3.org/2024/11/wg-pat-charter.html#private-attribution) of the [Private Advertising Technology Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/pat/) of [W3C](https://www.w3.org/)._

Attribution is the name given to the measurement system used in advertising. It is called attribution because it seeks to attribute value from an outcome (like someone buying stuff) to advertisements.

This repository contains [a specification](https://w3c.github.io/attribution/) that describes an API that would be presented by a browser to websites.

The specification contains all of the details. There is no [explainer](https://tag.w3.org/explainers/). All the explanation can be found up front, before it gets into the gory details.

The WG will use the process outlined [here](process.md) to develop this specification. Nothing contained therein is intended to override other W3C process and procedures.
